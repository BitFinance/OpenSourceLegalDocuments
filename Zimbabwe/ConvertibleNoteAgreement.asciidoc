1.	*Effective Date*: The effective date of this convertible note is the date of signature of this agreement.
2.	*Interest*: shall accrue on the outstanding Principal Amount, from the date hereof until this Note is converted or paid in full, at the rate of seven percent (7%) (the “Interest Rate”) per annum and shall be compounded annually on a 365 day basis. All accrued interest shall be due and payable in full upon maturity, conversion or prepayment of this Note, as provided herein. All cash payments received by the Purchaser in respect of this Note shall be applied first to accrued interest and thereafter to the repayment of the outstanding Principal Amount.
3.	*Maturity Date*. If not sooner paid or converted according to the terms hereof, the outstanding Principal Amount plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full two years from the date of this note (the "Maturity Date"). Upon or at any time after the Maturity Date, in lieu of demanding payment, the Purchaser may, at its option and sole discretion elect to convert the outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest under this Note into a number of shares of the Issuer's common stock (the "***Common Stock***"). Notwithstanding the value of the Issuer’s shares as at the Maturity Date, the Principal Amount and accrued interest shall convert to not less than 0.6% (zero point six percent) of common shares in the Issuer. In the event that the Principal Amount and accrued interest thereon is not paid in full on the Maturity Date and the Purchaser has not exercised its conversion right specified above, the Note will continue to accrue interest at the Default Rate (as defined below).
4.	 *Prepayment*. The Issuer may prepay this Note in whole or in part without the prior consent of the Purchaser.
5.	*Qualified Financing*. In the event of, and simultaneously with the initial closing of, a preferred stock or equity stock financing after the date hereof with at least US$ *<USD_AMT_IN_FIGURES_HERE>* of new invested capital (excluding any other outstanding debt securities (including convertible debt securities) issued by the Issuer) or a preferred stock financing in a lesser amount if approved in writing by the Majority Holders (in either case, a "***Qualified Financing***"), the outstanding Principal Amount and accrued interest under the Note shall automatically convert into shares of the same series of preferred stock as is issued in the Qualified Financing at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (a) the price obtained by multiplying (i) the price per share paid in the Qualified Financing by (ii) the applicable Conversion Percentage (as defined herein) The “***Conversion Percentage***” shall be set at eighty percent (*<MAX_CONVERSION_PERCENTAGE_IN_FIGURES_HERE>* %) on the date of issuance of this Note and shall decrease on the last day of each calendar month commencing the twenty first full calendar month this Note shall be outstanding in an amount equal to one percent (1%) per month, until reaching a Conversion Percentage of seventy percent (*<MIN_CONVERSION_PERCENTAGE_IN_FIGURES_HERE>*%), after which time there shall be no further reduction to the Conversion Percentage. “***Majority Holders***” means holders of Notes owning together two-thirds or more of the aggregate Principal Amount of all outstanding Notes. In conjunction with such conversion, the Holder shall become a party to and shall execute all applicable definitive agreements relating to such Qualified Financing (the "***Qualified Financing Agreements***").
6.	*Acquisition*. Immediately prior to the closing of a merger, share exchange, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or stock, reorganization or liquidation of the Issuer that results in the stockholders of the Issuer immediately prior to such transaction owning less than 50% of the voting capital stock of the Issuer (or its successor or parent corporation) immediately after the transaction or, in the case of a sale of assets or liquidation, the Company owning after the transaction less than substantially all of the assets owned by the Issuer prior to the transaction (other than an issuance of equity securities for the primary purpose of raising capital) or any other event that constitutes grounds for liquidation or winding up in terms of the Companies Act of Zimbabwe (Chapter 24:03) that occurs prior to the satisfaction in full by the  Issuer of all outstanding Principal amount and accrued interest under this Note (including through the conversion of such amounts into capital stock of the Issuer), the Purchaser may elect to either (i) convert all outstanding Principal Amount and accrued interest hereunder into shares of Issuer stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 2, or (ii) accelerate the Maturity Date to the date of closing of the Acquisition transaction and thereupon the Issuer shall be obligated to pay the Purchaser an amount equal to twice (two times) the outstanding Principal Amount in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder. In conjunction with such conversion in connection with an Acquisition, the Purchaser shall execute all documentation required to be executed by other stockholders of Issuer in connection with the Acquisition (the "Acquisition Agreements"), including without limitation escrow, indemnification and other similar agreements.
7.	*Effect of Conversion* Upon conversion of this Note into shares of the Issuer's capital stock in accordance with the terms hereof, and, if and as applicable, upon receipt by the Issuer of signature pages to the Qualified Financing Agreements or the Acquisition Agreements executed by the Purchaser, the Issuer shall promptly issue and deliver to the Purchaser (a) a certificate or certificates for the shares issuable upon such conversion of this Note ("***Conversion Shares***") and (b) a capitalization table that reflects the Issuer’s Fully-Diluted Number of Shares as of the Conversion Time (as defined below) certified as accurate and complete by a senior officer of the Issuer. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made, in the case of conversion pursuant to Section 2, as of the close of business on the Maturity Date or such earlier date as mutually agreeable to the Issuer and Purchaser; in the case of a Qualified Financing, simultaneously with the completion of the initial closing of the Qualified Financing; and in the case of an Acquisition, immediately prior to the closing of such Acquisition (in each case, the "***Conversion Time***"). The Purchaser shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Conversion Shares as of the Conversion Time. No fractional Conversion Shares shall be issued in connection with any conversion of this Note, and any fractional shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share in lieu of any such fraction. The issuance of Conversion Shares to the Purchaser upon conversion of this Note in accordance with its terms shall constitute satisfaction in full of the obligations of the Issuer under this Note.
