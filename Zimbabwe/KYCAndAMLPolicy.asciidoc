## 4 What is Money Laundering?

**4.1 Money laundering is the process by which criminally obtained money or other assets (criminal property) are exchanged for ‘clean’ money or other assets with no obvious link to their criminal origins. Criminal property may take any form, including money or money’s worth, securities, tangible property and intangible property. It also covers money, however come by, which is used to fund terrorism.**

**4.2 Money laundering is a term used which relates to offences involving the proceeds of crime or terrorism funds.**

**4.3 The Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act makes it an offence for any person to enter into an agreement or engage in any arrangement or transaction with anyone in connection with property that forms part of the proceeds of crime, whether that agreement, arrangement or transaction is legally enforceable or not and whose effect is to:**

- Conceal or disguise the nature, source, location, disposition, movement or ownership of the said property or,
- Enable or assist any person who has committed or commits an offence, whether in Zimbabwe or elsewhere to avoid prosecution; or,
- Remove or diminish any property acquired directly, or indirectly, as a result of the commission of an offence.

**5.1 Despite the variety of methods employed, the laundering process is accomplished in three stages. These stages, described below, may comprise numerous transactions by the launderers that could alert an institution of the criminal activity.**

- **Layering** - separating illicit proceeds from their source by creating complex layers of financial transactions designed to disguise the audit trail and provide anonymity.
- **Integration** - the provision of apparent legitimacy to criminally derived wealth. If the layering process has succeeded, an integration scheme places the laundered proceeds back into the economy in such a way that they re-enter the financial system appearing as normal business funds.
