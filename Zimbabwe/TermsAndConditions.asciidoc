## 9. 51% and other Digital Currency Attacks

Golix makes every commercially reasonable attempt to help prevent and mitigate Digital Currency attacks. If Golix is able to confirm that a Digital Currency active on the Exchange has been compromised or is under attack, Golix may immediately halt trading, deposits, and withdrawals for such Digital Currency. If it is determined that such an attack caused the Digital Currency to greatly decrease in value, Golix may discontinue trade activity on such cryptocurrency entirely. Resolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals, and user balances for an attacked Digital Currency will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Golix makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the Exchange and is not liable for any lost value or stolen property, whether or not it was negligent in providing the proper security.

## 10. Regulation

Golix is a duly incorporated company in terms of the laws of Zimbabwe. As with regard its operations no law in Zimbabwe precludes it from running an exchange and the RBZ is aware of our operations and is yet to set any regulations that deal with Digital Currency related businesses.

## 11.(AML) Anti-Money Laundering & (KYC) Know Your Customer Policy

Golix protects itself from involvement in any activity that facilitates money laundering or other criminal activities by following the existent provisions of the laws in Zimbabwe as well as Regulations set by the RBZ incorporating the international best practices.
Golix aims to reasonably identify each user by crosschecking user data against governmental watch lists, UN sanctions lists as well as 3rd party identity verification and authentication services. If a user or a user’s transaction is flagged as suspicious through our internal controls, Bitfinance will require additional proof of identification from the user and has the right to not permit any trades, deposits, and/or withdrawals until additional and verifiable proof of identity is received and the Compliance Officer has approved the user for use of the Exchange
By agreeing to our Terms, you acknowledge and understand that Golix maintains verification levels which require user participation and verification in order to obtain, with levelled permissions based on user-supplied information, our ability to verify it, and our internal policies. You accept that you may not be able to achieve a desired level of verification, and Bitfinance reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, the appropriate Verification Level for any user, as well as the right to downgrade users without prior notice. Bitfinance may, from time to time, implement policies restricting Verification Levels by nationality, country of residence, or any other factor. This may affect your ability to withdraw funds in your account and you indemnify Bitfinance against any losses associated with an inability to deposit and/or withdraw funds based on your verification level.
The information required of a User varies and will set the basis upon which a Users wallet is classified. There are three levels through which individuals can transact on the exchange and one level for companies or organizations and these are as follows:

a. Level 1- only the email address needs be furnished
b. Level 2 – a mobile number needs to be furnished
c. Level 3 - an national registration identification/drivers licence/passport and a proof of residence document have to be furnished

## 12. Trading Limits

The minimum USD deposit on the exchange shall be the sum of US$100.00 meaning that prior to the deposit of this amount you will not be able to trade on the exchange.
Due to the staggered levels of verification of identity there shall be limits as to the value to be withdrawn from the Users wallet and these limits are as follows;
a.	Level 1 : not more than US$10 000.00 per month
b.	Level 2 : not more than US$50 000.00
c.	Level 3 : not more than US$250 000.00
